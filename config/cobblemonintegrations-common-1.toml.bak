		#Any text prefixed with "$" will look for an associated lang entry. Example: "$crouch_message" pulls the lang entry "cobblemonintegrations.jade.pokemon_entity.crouch_message".
		#Finally, you can configure conditions using "<placeholder>:<conditions>" where conditions are an & separated list of "<hidden/unknown>_<when/unless>_<condition>".
